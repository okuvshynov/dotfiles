Commit the changes and write a very detailed summary of what we did to commit message.
Include both the original task and implementation notes, including what went well and what were the issues.

If the original instructions were given in a todo-like file:
 - If that file was a part of version control, commit any changes to that file as well
 - If that file was not a part of version control, treat it as temporary todo: summarize the instructions and subsequent user guidance into the commit message and/or persistent documentation files (CLAUDE.md) and clean up that file
