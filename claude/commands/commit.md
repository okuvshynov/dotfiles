Commit the changes and write a very detailed summary of what we did to commit message.
Include both the original task and implementation notes, including what went well and what were the issues.

If the instructions were given in a todo-like file, do not commit that file.
Instead, summarize the instructions and subsequent user guidance into the commit message.
