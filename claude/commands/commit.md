Commit the changes and write a very detailed summary of what we did to commit message.
Include both the original task and implementation notes, including what went well and what were the issues.

Very important: include both completed and next steps in the larger project/task we are working on, including the references to relevant files, documents, external resources.

If the original instructions were given in a todo-like file:
 - If that file was a part of version control, commit any changes to that file as well
 - If that file was not a part of version control, treat it as temporary todo: summarize the instructions and subsequent user guidance into the commit message and/or persistent documentation files (CLAUDE.md) and clean up that file

Before commit, make sure that important documentation files (plans, readme, progress tracking, study reports) are updated accordingly.
