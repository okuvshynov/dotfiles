Review the recent commit messages in the current branch to get up to speed on what we were working on.

Read:
- commit messages (most important)
- lists of files changed
- if any documentation markdown file changed, read those files.
- current CLAUDE.md and README.md

Summarize your understanding.

If you are on main/master branch, consider getting recent 5-10 commits first, and adjust if needed.

If you are not on main/master branch, get all the commits after branch diverged from main

Take into account not staged/not committed changes.
