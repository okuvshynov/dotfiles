Find where your branch split from main:
- Look at the commit history to identify the point where your branch diverged
- Everything after this point is what needs review

Do a housekeeping check on the current state of the project:
- Does CLAUDE.md relfect recent changes?
- does README.md contain up to date user instructions?
- Are there any large files (>500 LoC) which we need to refactor and split up?

If you need to make changes, plan ahead, but do them one by one.
