Find where your branch split from main:
- Look at the commit history to identify the point where your branch diverged
- Everything after this point is what needs review

If you are on main branch, read several recent commits to make the same check. Use both commit history and recent conversation.

Do a housekeeping check on the current state of the project:
- Does CLAUDE.md relfect recent changes?
- does README.md contain up to date user instructions?
- Are there any large files (>500 LoC) which we need to refactor and split up?

If you need to make changes, plan ahead, but do them one by one.
